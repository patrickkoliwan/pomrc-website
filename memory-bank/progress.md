- Previous tasks (About page enhancements, Junior Program data merging) are completed.
- Venue Hire page exists but needs refactoring.

## What's Left

- Complete the Venue Hire page refactor according to the new requirements (modal form).

## Blockers

- None currently identified.

## Completed Tasks

- See `tasks.md` for a detailed list of completed tasks and links to archives.

## Reflections / Learnings

- (To be added after task completion)
- **About Page Enhancement Task:**
  - Reusable components (`HeroSection`, `AnimatedSection`) improved organization.
  - `framer-motion` `whileInView` with `once: true` is effective for scroll animations.
  - Using parent `space-y-*` is often better than child `mb-*` for consistent spacing between wrapped sections.
  - Future improvements: Staggered gallery animations, custom focus rings, linked CTA.
